---------- INSTALL --------------------------------------------------------------------------

The recommended way to install Rapier is to launch XBMC and navigate to the official XBMC repository inside the add-ons node.
Any script dependencies that the skin requires will automatically be downloaded. If you already have the skin file, then go into the add-ons 
node and choose "Install from zip file" and select the Rapier zip file.

Manual installation can be done by moving the skin.rapier folder inside the zip file into your addons folder of your XBMC profile.
Please make sure you have the following scripts installed when doing it manually: 

script.favourites v5.0.2
script.artistslideshow v1.6.7
script.artwork.downloader v13.0.0
script.randomandlastitems v2.2.1
script.tv.show.next.aired v6.0.10
script.grab.fanart v0.13.0
script.globalsearch v2.0.8
service.skin.widgets v0.0.29

Troubleshoot: If there is a previous installation of Rapier, it is best to delete it first than to overwrite the files if installing manually.
Once installed it is also recommended to reset the skin settings by going to System->Skin Settings->Reset Skin.
You may also want to delete the textures.db file that resides in userdata->database of your XBMC profile directory.
Doing these steps will prevent any unforeseen problems that may pop up.

Rapier uses text images for the home menu categories. More categories can be found in skin.rapier->extras folder when customizing the home menu.
