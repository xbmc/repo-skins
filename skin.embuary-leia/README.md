# skin.embuary
Embuary is based on the web UI of Emby and has been developed for Emby-For-kodi users, but it doesn't require Emby at all and will also work with a regular Kodi setup.

# Terms of use
With the installation of the skin you agree that you don't use it in combination with blacklisted and illegal Kodi add-ons.
I'm not associated with any available build and I won't give any support to blacklisted, banned or illegal third party addons.
