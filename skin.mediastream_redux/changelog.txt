And So Marks the Version 1.0.0 of this skin, Maybe the last from me (aside from compatabilty updates). This one contains a Few of the things I did to the skin before I decided to move over to making Confluence from it. It still has all the original MediaStream_Redux look but with transperant home screen blade

Changes
- added a second list mode to files view thats full width of the background (I personally use it for tvheadend channel lists)
- Fixed Open your Favourites didn't hide "Open Your" if you set the skin setting to hide the labels in home
- Moved the hacky reading file name flagging items (bluray hddvd) to the far right of the view instead of the left
- Made the Media flagging in infowrap view go all the way to the edge so nothing gets cut off
- Updated greek language thanks ydatografida from XBMC forums
- Made the Home Blade more transperant (you can now see the images under it)
- Better mouse control in the skins side menus (still not prefect but much better)
- Replaced the Title fonts with th ones from Confluence. The look the same and have better unicode support and are 100% free unlike the original Mediastream ones
